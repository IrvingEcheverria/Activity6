        <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
        <h3>Juventus former player</3>

        <p>Today I depart from an amazing club, the biggest in Italy and surely one of the biggest in all of Europe.
          I gave my heart and soul for Juventus and I’ll always love the city of Turin until my final days.
          The “tifosi bianconeri” always respected me and I tried to thank that respect by fighting for them in every game, every season, every competition.
          In the end, we can all look back and realize that we achieved great things, not all that we wanted, but still, we wrote a pretty beautiful story together.

        <h2>Leonel Messi</h2>
        <h3>Barcelona former player</3>
        <p>I hope I can come back and be part of this club again, I’ve been here since I was 13.
          After 21 years I am leaving with my wife and three little Catalan-Argentine kids, and I can’t tell you everything.
          I can tell you in a few years we want to come back because this is my home.
          I am just really grateful to my teammates and former teammates, everyone that has been by my side.
          There are so many people. For this club, I have so much respect. So many beautiful things have happened.
          Also some bad things, but all this helped me to grow and improve and make me the person I am today.
